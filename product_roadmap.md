# Payjaro Backend Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step plan to build a fully working, scalable backend for the Payjaro platform, from core models to production launch.

---

## 1. Core Model Completion
- Implement all core models for:
  - Users (custom user model, user types)
  - Entrepreneurs (profiles, metrics, storefront)
  - Suppliers (profiles, onboarding)
  - Products (catalog, categories, inventory, pricing)
  - Orders (order flow, items, status history)
  - Payments (methods, transactions, escrow, earnings, withdrawals, wallet)
  - Logistics (shipping, delivery partners, shipments)
  - Social (storefront, sharing, referral)
  - Analytics (events, metrics, reports)
- Register models in admin, create migrations, and write factory-based tests.

---

## 2. API Layer (Django Rest Framework)
- Set up DRF serializers and viewsets for all major models.
- Implement authentication (JWT or session-based).
- Build endpoints for:
  - User registration, login, profile management
  - Entrepreneur onboarding, profile, storefront, analytics
  - Product catalog (list, search, detail, create for suppliers)
  - Order creation, tracking, status updates
  - Payment initiation, webhook handling, wallet management
  - Logistics: shipping calculation, tracking
  - Social: sharing, referral tracking, social post scheduling
- Add filtering, pagination, and permissions for all endpoints.
- Write API tests using DRFâ€™s test framework and factories.

---

## 3. Business Logic & Workflows
- Entrepreneur onboarding flow (multi-step, with verification)
- Product selection, markup setting, and storefront publishing
- Order placement, payment, and fulfillment (including inventory checks)
- Commission and earnings calculation
- Withdrawal and payout processing
- Supplier onboarding and product upload
- Automated notifications (email, SMS, WhatsApp, in-app)

---

## 4. Integrations
- Payment gateways: Paystack, Flutterwave, Crypto (webhooks, callbacks)
- Logistics APIs: GIG, Kwik, DHL, etc.
- Social APIs: WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook for sharing and analytics
- Email/SMS: Transactional notifications

---

## 5. Admin & Backoffice Tools
- Custom admin dashboards for user, order, and product management
- Manual order intervention (refunds, status changes)
- Supplier and entrepreneur verification tools
- Analytics and reporting dashboards

---

## 6. Security, Compliance, and Quality
- Implement permissions and role-based access control
- Data validation and error handling
- Rate limiting, throttling, and API security best practices
- GDPR/Nigerian data protection compliance
- Automated and manual security testing
- Full test coverage (unit, integration, end-to-end)

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability
- Caching (Redis), query optimization
- Asynchronous/background jobs (Celery, Django-Q)
- File/media storage (S3 or equivalent)
- Monitoring (Sentry, DataDog, Prometheus)
- Load and stress testing

---

## 8. Deployment & DevOps
- Dockerize the backend
- Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Staging and production environments
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
- Documentation for deployment and onboarding

---

## 9. Launch & Iteration
- Internal alpha (team testing)
- Closed beta (first sellers and suppliers)
- Public launch (Abuja electronics, then expand)
- Continuous improvement based on user feedback and analytics

## Is This Roadmap Detailed Enough?
- **Yes:** This roadmap covers every major technical and business milestone needed for a robust, scalable backend.
- **Each phase is broken down into actionable tasks.**
- **You can further break down each phase into weekly sprints or tickets as you execute.**
- **If you want even more granularity (e.g., specific API endpoints, test cases, or deployment scripts), you can expand each section as needed.**
